This is a design for a class project.
The brief was to design a website, focussing on what I've learned on my HTML and CSS course.
I decided to do a website for a fiend who owns a holiday park in West Wittering. Her brief was to focus on the beauty of the area and include information on the stylish caravan interiors. At this stage, she did not want a direct booking form, so we decided on a simple contact form instead.
